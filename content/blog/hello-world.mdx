# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post on my new Discord-themed portfolio website. I'm excited to share my journey as a software developer and the projects I'm working on.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Technical tutorials** and deep dives into technologies I'm exploring
- **Project showcases** with behind-the-scenes insights
- **Career insights** and lessons learned in software development
- **Open source contributions** and community involvement

## About This Site

This portfolio is built with:
- **Next.js 15** with the App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **Discord-inspired UI** for a unique experience

I wanted to create something that stands out from typical portfolio sites, so I chose a Discord theme that reflects my love for gaming and community-driven development.

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more posts about:
- Performance optimization techniques
- Building scalable web applications
- My journey learning new technologies

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
